 <p><h3>Life can be depressing sometimes; as founders, we understand that. In many circumstances, people just want the ability to rant about what troubles them. We have grown up in a generation that fully depends on technology; therefore, dealing with emotions is something new and intimidating.
   When not interpreted properly, these emotions become dangerous and overpowering. This can be an even bigger problem when the danger is brought upon you by a loved one; a bully; a stranger. As people, we have to keep in mind that words do hurt.
   They have the power to burrow into one's skin and accumulate into tumors; a cancer that feeds off depression. Instead of acting on instinct, we should gather for the greater good and spread the word of happiness. Whether it's listening to a friend, writing your thoughts, or thinking before speaking, we can all help stop abusive scenarios.
   For ourselves and others around us.</h3></div>

    have been doing this since we established our company in July
    of 2018. Even though we have not been in this business for that
    long we know a thing or two about the stress department. Working
    in this group with extraordinary women has taught all of us to
    be more compassionate and the importance to always do our best for our
    consumers. We all live by our motto "be the bestest from the
    restest" so our users can have the best possible experience
    when getting the help they need.
